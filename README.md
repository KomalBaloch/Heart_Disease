### **AIMS**
- `Disease Prediction`: The primary aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of 14 attributes. This involves classifying individuals into various categories of heart disease severity or absence thereof, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis and management.
- `Insight Generation`: Another significant aim is to extract insights from the heart disease dataset that could help in better understanding the correlations and patterns among various attributes related to heart health.

### **OBJECTIVES**
- `Data Handling and Preparation`: Efficiently import and handle the dataset to ensure it is clean, structured, and ready for analysis. This includes managing missing data, outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
- `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the distribution and relationships among various features within the dataset. This helps in identifying patterns, anomalies, and underlying structures.
- `Data Visualization`: Utilize various visualization tools to represent data findings effectively. This aids in making the data analysis accessible and understandable to all stakeholders.
- `Preprocessing`: Implement data preprocessing techniques such as scaling, encoding, and transformation to prepare the dataset for optimal performance of machine learning models.
- `Model Selection and Training`: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to find the most effective ones for predicting heart disease. This includes logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, and more.
- `Model Evaluation`: Assess the performance of the machine learning models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves to ensure reliability and validity of the predictive models.
- `Implementation of Predictive Model`: Develop a robust predictive model that can be integrated into healthcare systems for real-time prediction of heart disease.
